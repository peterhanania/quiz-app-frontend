This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project made with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Getting Started

Before you get started, you will need to setup the backend server at [github.com/peterhanania/quiz-app-backend](https://github.com/peterhanania/quiz-app-backend). Once you set everything up and you run your project locally, get your API URL (Ex. http://localhost:3001) and set it in:

- `.env.local` `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=YOUR API URL (Ex. http://localhost:3001)`

Then, you can get started by installing the dependencies and running the following command:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

then

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
